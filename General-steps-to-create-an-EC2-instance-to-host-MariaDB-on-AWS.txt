1.Sign in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 service.

2.Click the "Launch Instance" button to start the EC2 instance creation wizard.

3.Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that supports MariaDB, such as Amazon Linux or Ubuntu.

4.Select an instance type based on the size and performance requirements of your database. A general-purpose instance like the t3.small or t3.medium is usually sufficient for small to medium-sized databases.

5.Configure the instance details, including the network settings, security groups, and storage options.

6.In the "Configure Security Group" step, add a new rule to allow incoming traffic on the default MariaDB port 3306. This will enable remote access to the database from other systems.

7.Review the instance details and click "Launch" to create the instance.

8.Once the instance is launched, connect to it using SSH and install MariaDB using the package manager of your operating system.

9.After installing MariaDB, configure it according to your requirements, such as creating a database, creating a user with appropriate permissions, and configuring backup and recovery.

10.Once MariaDB is configured and running, test the connection to the database from a remote client.

Keep in mind that these are general steps, and the exact process may vary depending on the specific configuration and requirements of your environment. 
It is recommended to follow AWS documentation and best practices when creating and configuring EC2 instances to ensure they are secure, scalable, and performant.
